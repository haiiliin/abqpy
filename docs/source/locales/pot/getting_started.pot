msgid "`abqpy` is a Python package providing type hints for Python scripting of Abaqus, you can use it to write you Python script of Abaqus fluently, even without doing anything in Abaqus. It also provides some simple APIs to execute the Abaqus commands so that you can run your Python script to build the model, submit the job and extract the output data in just one Python script, even without opening the Abaqus/CAE."

msgid "When we use the Abaqus/CAE graphical user interface (GUI) to create a model and to visualize the results, commands are issued internally by Abaqus/CAE after every operation. These commands reflect the geometry you created along with the options and settings you selected from each dialog box. The GUI generates commands in an object-oriented programming language called Python. The commands issued by the GUI are sent to the Abaqus/CAE kernel. The kernel interprets the commands and uses the options and settings to create an internal representation of our model. The kernel is the brains behind Abaqus/CAE. The GUI is the interface between the user and the kernel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:104
msgid "In a word, Abaqus use Python language to interact with the Abaqus kernel, everything that can be done in Abaqus/CAE, can also be done using Python script. Abaqus has already installed a Python interpreter so that Abaqus/CAE can use it to interact with the Abaqus kernel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:108
msgid "For some reasons, we cannot directly use the Python interpreter inside Abaqus to build an Abaqus model. But fortunately, we can use the commands provided by Abaqus to access it. i.e."

msgid "Another Python interpreter, is the Python interpreter installed by ourselves, where `abqpy` is installed. `abqpy` provides a bridge to connect our Python script to Abaqus Python interpreter, it provides type hints for Python scripting for Abaqus, enabling us to write a Abaqus Python script quickly."

msgid "How does this package work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:138
msgid "`abqpy` is just a package to provide type hints for Abaqus/Python scripting, it is installed outside Abaqus/Python environment, you can use `abqpy` to write your Abaqus/Python scripts, and run the scripts inside Abaqus on your own. However, with the help of Abaqus command, an easier way can be achieved: **you can actually run the script using your own Python interpreter without opening Abaqus**, which is achieved via the **abaqus** command like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:147
msgid "The secret is hided in the {py:meth}`~abqpy.abaqus.run` function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:163
msgid "In this package, the {py:mod}`~abaqus` module is reimplemented to automatically call this function. If you import this module in the top of your script (i.e., `from abaqus import *`), your Python interpreter (not Abaqus Python interpreter) will call this function and use the **abaqus** command to submit the script to Abaqus. After it is submitted to Abaqus, {py:meth}`~abqpy.abaqus.run` will exit the interpreter, because the script will already run in Abaqus Python interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:168
msgid "In the output script, we might not want to always use the {py:mod}`~abaqus` module, because it needs the Abaqus/CAE kernel (and its license). Instead, we use the module {py:mod}`~odbAccess` (i.e., `from odbAccess import *`), which requires only the Abaqus Python interpreter. Then, another similar **abaqus** command line is needed:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:176
msgid "So, the {py:mod}`~odbAccess` module is also reimplemented to call the {py:meth}`~abqpy.abaqus.run` function, and the actual implementation of this function is similar to:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started.md:194
msgid "In summary: this function will be called when you import one of the two modules ({py:mod}`~abaqus` or {py:mod}`~odbAccess`). It will pass the argument `cae = True` in {py:mod}`~abaqus` module and `cae = False` in {py:mod}`~odbAccess` module. Therefore, if you want to run your Python script in Abaqus Python environment, please make sure to import one of these modules on the top of your script."
