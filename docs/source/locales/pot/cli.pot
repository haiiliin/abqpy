msgid "The command line interface is based on the [`fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire)  package since version `20**.5.0`, and it is not compatible with the command line interface of previous versions."

msgid "The default execution procedure invoked by `abqpy` inside the Python interpreter environment where it is installed is to run one of the two following command lines:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:12
msgid "When the `abaqus` module is imported for the first time:"

msgid "These commands lines are invoked when you run your script containing the above statements in your installed Python interpreter, with a simple command line launch:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:31
msgid "However, there are other execution procedures that can be run with the `abaqus` command and also another options that could be passed to these commands. To supply that procedures and options, `abqpy` provides two alternatives. One of them is a separate **command line interface** (another alternative is to use an {doc}`System Environment Variable <envvars>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:37
msgid "Currently, `abqpy` command line interface provides several execution modes: **Abaqus/CAE Execution** mode and **Abaqus Python Execution** mode, and more:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:42
msgid "where `COMMAND` is one of `abaqus`, `cae`, `python`, `run` or any other Abaqus commands,  `SCRIPT` is the file name of your python script, `flags` are the options that could be  passed to the command, and `ARGS` are the extra arguments to be passed after the command  line options. For details, see the [References](#references) section or run  `abqpy COMMAND --help` for help."

msgid "For the following commands, the boolean flags can be specified with the following syntax (take `gui` as an example):"

#: ../../cli.md:89
msgid "Some modern Python IDEs allow you to customize the default python launch parameters that will be passed to the interpreter. This feature permits to run `abqpy` command line interface as a module script and customize your default abaqus execution procedure."

msgid "Example: In [VS Code Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), you can specify the following setting:"

#: ../../cli.md:101
msgid "That setting will make VS Code Python Extension run by default all python script files in the integrated terminal with the following command line:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:108
msgid "Which provides a way to change the default abaqus execution procedure to GUI mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:111
msgid "Noted that if a token other than another flag immediately follows a flag that's supposed to be a boolean,  the flag will take on the value of the token rather than the boolean value.  Thus `--gui=True` instead of `--gui` is used here to prevent this problem."
