msgid "When you assign a variable in a Python program, the variable refers to a Python object, but the variable is not an object itself. For example, the expression numSpokes=3 creates a variable that refers to an integer object; however, numSpokes is not an object. You can change the object to which a variable refers. numSpokes can refer to a real number on one line, an integer on the next line, and a viewport on the next line."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user/python/introduction/python-basics.md:54
msgid "An object always has a type. In our example the type of `mdb.models['Model A']` is Model. An object's type cannot be changed. The type defines the data encapsulated by an object—its members—and the functions that can manipulate those data—its methods. Unlike most programming languages, you do not need to declare the type of a variable before you use it. Python determines the type when the assignment statement is executed. The Abaqus Scripting Interface uses the term object to refer to a specific Abaqus type as well as to an instance of that type; for example, a Model object refers to a Model type and to an instance of a Model type."
