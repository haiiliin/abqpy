msgid "You can define your own functions in Python. A function is like a subroutine in Fortran. You can pass arguments into a function, it performs the operation, and it can return one or more values. For example, the following function returns the distance of a point from the origin. The def statement starts a function definition."

msgid "One of the methods provided by Abaqus uses as many as 50 arguments. Some of the arguments are required by the method; others are optional, and Abaqus provides an initial or default value. Fortunately, you can call a function or a method without providing every optional argument if you use Python's keyword arguments. A keyword specifies the argument that you are providing. Keyword arguments also make your scripts more readable. For example, the following defines a function called calculateCylinderVolume:"

A documentation string appears at the top of a function and is delimited by triple quotes \"\"\". You can use the __doc__ method to obtain the documentation string from a function while running the Python interpreter. For example,"

#: ../../user/python/introduction/programming.rst:178
msgid "Dictionaries are a powerful tool in Python. A dictionary maps a variable to a set of data, much like a real dictionary maps a word to its definition, its pronunciation, and its synonyms. Dictionaries are similar to lists in that they are not homogeneous and can contain objects of any type. To access an object in a list, you provide the integer index that specifies the position of the object in the list. For example,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/python/introduction/programming.rst:186
msgid "In contrast, you access an object in a dictionary through its key, which can be a string, an integer, or any type of immutable Python object. There is no implicit order to the keys in a dictionary. In most cases you will assign a string to the dictionary key. The key then becomes a more intuitive way to access the elements in a dictionary. You use square brackets and the dictionary key to access a particular object. For example,"

The action of signaling a problem during execution is called raising or throwing an exception. Recognizing the problem is called catching an exception. Taking appropriate action is called exception handling."

msgid "If the file does not exist, the statement fails, and Python displays the following error message:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you use exception handling, you can catch the error, display a helpful message, and take the appropriate action. For example, a revised version of the code attempts to open the same file within a try statement. If an IOError error is encountered, the except statement catches the IOError exception and assigns the exception's value to the variable error."

msgid "Many functions, however, are not built-in; for example, most of the math functions, such as `sin()` and `cos()`, are not available when you start Python. Functions that are not built-in are defined in modules. Modules are a way of grouping functionality and are similar to a Fortran library of subroutines. For example, the following code could be the opening lines of a Python script. The code imports the Python module `sys` and uses the `argv` member of `sys` to print the command line arguments:"

msgid "The `import` approach shown above imports the module as a unit, and you must qualify the name of an object from the module. To access a function from the `math` module in our example, you must prepend the function with `math.`; the `math.` statement is said to qualify the `sin()` function."

msgid "What is the difference between the two approaches to importing modules? If two modules contain an object with the same name, Python cannot distinguish between the objects if you use the `from modulename import *` approach. If two objects have the same name, Python uses the object most recently imported. However, if you use the `import modulename` approach, modulename qualifies the name of the object and makes it unique."
