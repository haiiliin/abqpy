msgid "You should not rely on the integer id to identify a vertex, edge, face, or cell in a region command; for example, myFace=myModel.parts['Door'].faces[3]. The id can change if you add or delete features to your model; in addition, the id can change with a new release of Abaqus."

#: ../../user/python/use-scripts/specify-region.rst:17
msgid "Rather than using the integer `id`, you should use the `findAt` method to identify a vertex, edge, face, or cell. The arguments to `findAt` are an arbitrary point on an edge, face, or cell or the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of a vertex. `findAt` returns an object that contains the `id` of the vertex or the `id` of the edge, face, or cell that includes the arbitrary point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/python/use-scripts/specify-region.rst:19
msgid "`findAt` initially uses the ACIS tolerance of 1E-6. As a result, `findAt` returns any entity that is at the arbitrary point specified or at a distance of less than 1E-6 from the arbitrary point. If nothing is found, `findAt` uses the tolerance for imprecise geometry (applicable only for imprecise geometric entities). If necessary, it can open the tolerance further to find a suitable object. The arbitrary point must not be shared by a second edge, face, or cell. If two entities intersect or coincide at the arbitrary point, `findAt` chooses the first entity that it encounters, and you should not rely on the return value being consistent."

msgid "Alternatively, if you are working with an existing model that contains named regions, you can specify a region by referring to its name. For example, in the example described in Investigating the skew sensitivity of shell elements, you create a model using Abaqus/CAE. While you define the model, you must create a set that includes the vertex at the center of a planar part and you must name the set `CENTER`. You subsequently run a script that parameterizes the model and performs a series of analyses. The script uses the named region to retrieve the displacement and the bending moment at the center of the plate. The following statement refers to the set that you created and named using Abaqus/CAE:"
