msgid "Some methods take arguments that are described as a sequence of sequences of Floats or a sequence of sequences of Ints. Data that are entered into the table editor in Abaqus/CAE appear as a sequence of sequences in the equivalent Abaqus Scripting Interface command. In effect the data are a two-dimensional array. The data across one row form one sequence, and multiple rows form a sequence of those sequences."
