msgid "You may want to request input from a user while an Abaqus Scripting Interface script is executing. There are many reasons for requesting input; for example, to specify design parameters, to enable a macro to take action based on the input received, or to force parts of the script to be repeated. The Abaqus Scripting Interface provides three functions that request input from the user and return the data entered by the user:"

The value is returned to the executing script as a String after the user presses the **\\[Enter\\]** key or clicks **\\[OK\\]**. Optionally, you can specify a default value to be displayed in the text field. The `getInput` function does not provide any error checking; it is the script author's responsibility to verify the user input.
