msgid "Namespace is an important concept for the Abaqus Scripting Interface programmer. A namespace can be thought of as a program execution environment, and namespaces are independent of each other. Namespaces prevent conflict between variable names. You can use the same variable name to refer to different objects in different name spaces. :numref:`acl-all-schematic-nls-2` illustrates how commands interact with the Abaqus/CAE kernel."

msgid "The statement `from abaqus import *` described in Executing scripts imports the mdb variable into the script namespace. You can then use the mdb variable in your scripts to access the objects in the object model. Although variables in one namespace are not visible to the other namespace, the object repositories are now available in both. As a result, an object created in one namespace can still be referred to in another namespace if you use its full path (`mdb.models['Model A']...`) and its repository key."
