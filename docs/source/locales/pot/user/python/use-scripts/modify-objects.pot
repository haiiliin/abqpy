msgid "Most Abaqus objects have a method that creates a copy of the object. The same command provides the name of the new object. Methods that create a copy of an object are called copy constructors. Although copy constructors exist for most objects, in most cases they are not documented in the Abaqus Scripting Reference Guide. The format of a copy constructor is"

These objects are sometimes referred to as temporary, and the delete semantics for these objects are the same as for standard Python objects. The object exists as long as there is a reference to it. If you delete the reference, the object is also deleted."
