msgid "You can extend the functionality of the Abaqus Scripting Interface by writing your own modules that contain classes and functions to accomplish tasks that are not directly available in Abaqus. For example, you can write a function to print the names of all materials that have a density specified, or you can write a function that creates a contour plot using a custom set of contour plot options. Creating functions and modules in Python is described in {ref}`creating-functions` and {ref}`functions-and-modules`."

msgid "If you extend the kernel functionality by writing your own classes and functions, you may want to store data required by those classes or functions in the Abaqus/CAE model database so the data are available the next time you open the database. To store custom kernel data in the Abaqus/CAE model database, you must make use of the `customKernel` module. The `customKernel` module augments the mdb object with a member called customData. When you save a model database, Abaqus/CAE also saves any data created below the customData object."

msgid "You can store almost any type of Python object under `mdb.customData`; for example, strings, numbers, and Python classes. However, there are some restrictions; for example, you cannot store file objects. These restrictions are due to the fact that the Abaqus/CAE infrastructure uses Python’s `pickle` module to store the `customData` object in the model database. The `pickle` module allows the Python programmer to write a data structure to a file and then recreate that data structure when reading from the file. For details on the restrictions imposed by the `pickle` module, see the official Python website (<https://www.python.org>)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/python/python-abaqus/extending.md:33
msgid "If your code creates a custom class and stores an instance of the class in the model database, the custom module that defined that custom class must be available for Python to unpickle the data when the database is subsequently opened. Consequently, if a user saves custom data to a model database and then passes that model database to another user, the other user must also have access to the custom modules that produced the custom data. Otherwise, they will not be able to load the custom data into their Abaqus/CAE session."
