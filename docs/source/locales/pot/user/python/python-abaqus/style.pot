In contrast, methods that operate on an object begin with a lowercase character. The description of each constructor in the {doc}`/references` includes a path to the command. For example, the following describes the path to the Viewport constructor:"

However, if you are creating or writing to an output database, you may need to use constructors to create new objects, such as part instances and steps.

The initial value given for the argument is the initial value assigned to the corresponding member when Abaqus creates the object. For example, the defaultViewportAnnotationOptions object has no constructor; Abaqus creates the defaultViewportAnnotationOptions object when you start a session. When you create a new viewport, the settings are copied from the current viewport."
