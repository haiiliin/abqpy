In contrast, methods that operate on an object begin with a lowercase character. The description of each constructor in the :doc:`/references` includes a path to the command. For example, the following describes the path to the Viewport constructor:"

The initial value given for the argument is the initial value assigned to the corresponding member when Abaqus creates the object. For example, the defaultViewportAnnotationOptions object has no constructor; Abaqus creates the defaultViewportAnnotationOptions object when you start a session. When you create a new viewport, the settings are copied from the current viewport."
