msgid "You should now be familiar with some of the concepts behind object-oriented programming, such as objects, constructors, methods, and members. This section describes how object-oriented programming relates to the Abaqus Scripting Interface and summarizes some of the terminology."

msgid "Most Abaqus Scripting Interface commands are methods. For example,"

msgid "A constructor is a method that creates an object. By convention, all constructor names and all objects start with an uppercase character in the Abaqus Scripting Interface. The name of a constructor is usually the same as the name of the type of object it creates. In the following example `Viewport` is a constructor that creates a Viewport object called `myViewport`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/python/python-abaqus/oop.rst:25
msgid "Some objects do not have a constructor. The object is created as a member of another object when the first object is created. For example, Abaqus creates the vertices of a part when you create a part's geometry, and the coordinates of the vertices are stored as Vertex objects. The Vertex objects are members of the Part object. The following statement prints the coordinates of the first vertex of a part:"

#: ../../user/python/python-abaqus/oop.rst:43
msgid "An object has members as well as methods. A member can be thought of as a property of an object. For example, `width` is a member of the Viewport object. The following statements show how you access a member of an object:"

msgid "The standard Python statement `object.__members__` lists all the members of an object. For example, the following statement lists all the members of a Viewport object:"

#: ../../user/python/python-abaqus/oop.rst:56
msgid "The values of members are specific to each instance of the object. For example, the value of the `width` member of a Viewport object is specific to each viewport."

#: ../../user/python/python-abaqus/oop.rst:58
msgid "Members of an Abaqus object are read-only; consequently, you cannot change their value with a simple assignment statement. You use the `setValues()` method to change the value of a member. For example, the `setValues()` statement in the following script changes the thickness of a shell section:"
