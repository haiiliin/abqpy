msgid "The basics of Python's exception handling apply to the Abaqus Scripting Interface. Python's exception handling is described in :ref:`error-handling`. If certain circumstances arise while a script is running, Python allows you to take the necessary action and still allows the script to continue. Alternatively, when Abaqus/CAE issues (or \"throws\") an exception and the exception is not handled by the script, Abaqus/CAE displays the exception message in the message area and the script stops executing."

Instance names of models that have been instantiated as model instances in another model still have a 38-character limit. For imported sets/surfaces, parts, and model instances, the names are generated internally in Abaqus/CAE by combining part/instance/set names. You must ensure that the combined length will not exceed 80 characters; otherwise, the data check analysis will fail."
