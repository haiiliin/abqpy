In `Creating and Analyzing a Simple Model in Abaqus/CAE <https://help.3ds.com/2021/English/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEGSARefMap/simagsa-m-Caebeam-sb.htm?contextscope=all#simagsa-m-Caebeam-sb>`_, you create a model of a steel cantilever beam and load its top surface. You then analyze the beam and plot the resulting stresses and displacements. :numref:`gst-beam` illustrates the model that you create and analyze."

msgid "The first line of the script, `from abaqus import *`, imports the Mdb and Session objects. The current viewport is `session.viewports['Viewport: 1']`, and the current model is `mdb.models['Model-1']`. Both of these objects are available to the script after you import the `abaqus` module. The second line of the script, `from abaqusConstants import *`, imports the Symbolic Constants defined in the Abaqus Scripting Interface. The script then creates a new model that will contain the cantilever beam example and creates a new viewport in which to display the model and the results of the analysis. For a description of the commands used in this section, see the appropriate sections in the :doc:`/references`."

msgid "The script then imports the `Part` module. Most of the sections in this example begin with importing the appropriate module, which illustrates how a script can import a module at any time to extend or augment the object model. However, the Abaqus Scripting Interface has a convention that all the required modules are imported at the start of a script; and that convention is followed in other example scripts in this guide."
