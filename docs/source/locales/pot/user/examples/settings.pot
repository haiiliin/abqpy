msgid "You can use the Abaqus Scripting Interface to edit the abaqus_2021.gpr file, which includes settings that control many default display preferences and GUI settings in the Abaqus/CAE user interface. To enable editing of this file, you must import the caePrefsAccess module. This section describes the structure of the abaqus_2021.gpr file and provides an overview of customizing its settings; for more detailed information about the functions available in the caePrefsAccess module, see {doc}`/reference/kernel/cae_display_preferences`."

msgid "Editing the `abaqus_2021.gpr` file is for experienced users only. Do not use the functions in the `caePrefsAccess` module unless you are comfortable with the Abaqus Scripting Interface and understand the structure of the `abaqus_2021.gpr` file. In addition, you should not have Abaqus/CAE running when you make changes to the graphical preferences file."

The file records default settings in two sections: display options reside in the `sessionOptions` section, and GUI settings reside in the `guiPreferences` section. Editing the options in one section does not have any effect on the options in the other section."

A separate `guiPreferences` record is stored in the preferences file for each display you use, so you must specify the **displayName** you want to modify when you open the `guiPreferences` settings. You can obtain a list of the available **displayName** settings by calling the `getDisplayNamesInGuiPreferences` function, and you can edit these settings by using the `openGuiPreferences` function and specifying the **displayName** of the settings that you want to modify."
