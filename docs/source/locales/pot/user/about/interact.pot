msgid "The Abaqus Scripting Interface allows you to bypass the Abaqus/CAE GUI and communicate directly with the kernel. A file containing Abaqus Scripting Interface commands is called a script. You can use scripts to do the following:"

#: ../../user/about/interact.rst:16
msgid "To automate repetitive tasks. For example, you can create a script that executes when a user starts an Abaqus/CAE session. Such a script might be used to generate a library of standard materials. As a result, when the user enters the Property module, these materials will be available. Similarly, the script might be used to create remote queues for running analysis jobs, and these queues will be available in the Job module."

msgid "To perform a parametric study. For example, you can create a script that incrementally modifies the geometry of a part and analyzes the resulting model. The same script can read the resulting output databases, display the results, and generate annotated hard copies from each analysis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create and modify the model databases and models that are created interactively when you work with Abaqus/CAE. The Abaqus Scripting Interface is an application programming interface (API) to your model databases and models. For a discussion of model databases and models, see `What is an Abaqus/CAE model database? <https://help.3ds.com/2021/english/dssimulia_established/SIMACAECAERefMap/simacae-c-dbsconcepts.htm?contextscope=all>`_ and `What is an Abaqus/CAE model? <https://help.3ds.com/2021/english/dssimulia_established/SIMACAECAERefMap/simacae-m-DbsConcWhatismodel-sb.htm?contextscope=all>`_ \"This section describes an Abaqus/CAE model\"."
