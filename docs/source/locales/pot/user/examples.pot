You can use the scripts to create Abaqus/CAE models, submit jobs for analysis, and view the results. For examples of scripts that read and write from an output database, see `Example scripts that access data from an output database <https://help.3ds.com/2021/English/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAECMDRefMap/simacmd-m-OdbIntroExamplesPyc-sb.htm?contextscope=all>`_."

You use Abaqus/CAE to create the model, and you use Abaqus Scripting Interface commands to parameterize an evaluation of the model by changing its geometry and element type. The example investigates the sensitivity of the shell elements in Abaqus to skew distortion when they are used as thin plates."
