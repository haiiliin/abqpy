msgid "The Abaqus PDE is designed to work any type of Python files, including `.guiLog` files. A `.guiLog` is a Python script that records actions in the Abaqus/CAE GUI. When you create a `.guiLog`, it records every mouse click, dialog box entry, and menu, tool, or viewport selection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/environment/use-pde.md:9
msgid "To record actions from Abaqus/CAE, the Abaqus PDE session must be associated with a Abaqus/CAE session. The Abaqus PDE and Abaqus/CAE sessions are associated if you started them together from a command prompt or if you started the Abaqus PDE by selecting File -> Abaqus PDE in Abaqus/CAE. For more information on starting the Abaqus PDE, see [Starting the Abaqus Python development environment](https://help.3ds.com/2021/English/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAECMDRefMap/simacmd-c-pdestart.htm?contextscope=all)."

msgid "When you record .guiLog files, do not use mouse button 2 to close the dialog box for a procedure. Instead, use the buttons in the dialog box to close it. Using mouse button 2 adds multiple dialog box closing commands to the recorded .guiLog file.

#: ../../user/environment/use-pde.md:40
msgid "The Abaqus PDE runs scripts using one of three processes - GUI, kernel, or local. By default, `.guiLog` files are run in the Abaqus/CAE GUI process. If the Abaqus PDE was opened from within Abaqus/CAE, `.py` files and all other file types are run in the Abaqus/CAE kernel process by default. If the Abaqus PDE was opened without Abaqus/CAE, `.py` files are run in the local process by default. The local process runs the script without Abaqus/CAE, using Python in the local (PDE) process. You can change the process by selecting **Settings -> Run Script** In and choosing the desired process, or by clicking the **GUI**, **Kernel**, or **Local** radio buttons located above the main window. If the Abaqus PDE was opened without Abaqus/CAE and you run a script with the **GUI** or **Kernel** process, Abaqus PDE will start Abaqus/CAE to run the script."

To add a variable to the watch list, click mouse button 3 over the variable name in the Abaqus PDE main window and select **Add Watch: variable name** from the menu that appears. The Abaqus PDE adds the variable to the watch list, indicating the namespace that the variable is defined within, the variable name, the type of data the variable can store, the current value, and the file and line where the variable is located. When you execute or step through the script, the variable information is updated as needed. You can also activate the watch list tool after starting the debugger by selecting **Show Watch** from the action buttons below the call stack area or by selecting **Window -> Debug Windows -> Watch List**. Abaqus displays the Watch List area below the debugger or below the main window if the debugger is not open."

The `repr()` function returns a string that is better suited to being read by the Python interpreter, while the `str()` function returns a string better suited to printing. For more information about the built-in Python functions `repr()` and `str()`, refer to the official Python website (<https://www.python.org>)."
