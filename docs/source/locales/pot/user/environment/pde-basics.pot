If you plan to work on scripts that use the Abaqus/CAE GUI, you should start the Abaqus PDE from within an Abaqus/CAE session or start it from the command prompt when you start Abaqus/CAE. These startup methods link the Abaqus PDE to the corresponding Abaqus/CAE session. Alternatively, you can start the Abaqus PDE independently to save system memory or avoid using an Abaqus license."
