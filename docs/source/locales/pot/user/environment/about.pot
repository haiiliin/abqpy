msgid "The Abaqus PDE is a separate application that you can access from within Abaqus/CAE or launch independently to work on Python scripts."

msgid "It is intended primarily for use with scripts that use the Abaqus/CAE graphical user interface (GUI) or kernel commands, including plug-ins, but you can also use it to work on scripts that are unrelated to Abaqus. The Abaqus PDE also enables you to set breakpoints to pause script execution at a particular line in any Python script, including an Abaqus plug-in."
