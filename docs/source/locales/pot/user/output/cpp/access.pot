msgid "This section provides information that may be helpful to users who need to access results in an output database from an existing application. Most users should find that the **abaqus make** utility is sufficient for their postprocessing needs. Since linking and executing with dynamically linked runtime libraries is highly system dependent, the information in this section is intended for users who have an advanced working knowledge of compilation and linking with runtime libraries."

The “System Requirements” document lists the name and version of the compiler used for the Abaqus release on each supported platform. You can access this document through the **System Information** section of the **Support** page at https:www.3ds.com/simulia. You can also find information on compiling and linking with the C++ interface to an output database in the Dassault Systèmes Knowledge Base at https://support.3ds.com/knowledge-base/."
