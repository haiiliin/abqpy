msgid "This section describes the architecture of the Abaqus C++ interface to an output database. The output database is an object-oriented database, which means that the data are held by “objects” (C++ classes) that have certain behavior (C++ methods). The methods of an object in the database allow access to and manipulation of the data held by the object. The data members of an object can be either primitives (integer, floating point, string) or other objects."

msgid "You create a persistent object by calling a method on an existing Abaqus C++ API object. In Abaqus the convention is that the constructor method name corresponds to the name of the object created and that the first letter of the constructor name is capitalized. The object can be accessed using the return value of the constructor call or using a lowercase version of the method name. For example, a Frame object can be created using the following:"

Nodes, elements, and field values are created using the `addNodes`, `addElements`, and `addData` methods, respectively. For example, you use the addNodes method to create and retrieve nodes:"

msgid "To use a class in a C++ program, the relevant header files must be included. The naming convention followed is that the file name is the same as the name of the class declared in the header file. For example, the `odb_FieldValue` object is declared in the file `odb_FieldValue.h`. The file `odb_API.h` includes all the header files required to use the API. Other header files must be included to use some classes:"
