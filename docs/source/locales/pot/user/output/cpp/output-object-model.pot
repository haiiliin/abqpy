Parts are reusable; they can be instanced multiple times in the assembly. Parts are not analyzed directly; a part is like a blueprint for its instances.

Various element types require different section types to complete their definitions. For example, shell elements in a composite part require a section that provides a thickness, multiple material models, and an orientation for each material model; all these pieces combine to complete the composite shell element definition. Like materials, only those sections that are used in the assembly are copied to the output database."

You can also use field output to generate an **X - Y** data plot. Only complete sets of basic variables (for example, all the stress or strain components) can be requested as field output. Field output is composed of a cloud of data values (e.g., stress tensors at each integration point for all elements). Each data value has a location, type, and value. You use the regions defined in the model data, such as an element set, to access subsets of the field output data. :numref:`odb-field-nls-1` shows the field output data object model within an output database."
