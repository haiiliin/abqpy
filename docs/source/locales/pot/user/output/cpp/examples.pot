In most cases a large output database results from excessive field output being generated over a large number of frames. The Abaqus C++ API does not support the deletion of data from an output database; however, you can use this example program to copy data from select frames into a second output database created by a **datacheck** analysis that has identical model data. The original analysis and the **datacheck** analysis must be run using the same number of processors because the internal organization of data may differ based on the number of processors. The program uses addData to copy data at specified frames from the large output database into the new output database. The addData method works only when the model data in the two output databases are identical. For more information, see :py:meth:`~abaqus.Odb.FieldOutput.FieldOutput.addData`."
