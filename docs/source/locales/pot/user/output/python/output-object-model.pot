Various element types require different section types to complete their definitions. For example, shell elements in a composite part require a section that provides a thickness, multiple material models, and an orientation for each material model; all these pieces combine to complete the composite shell element definition.

You can also use field output to generate an **X - Y** data plot. Only complete sets of basic variables (for example, all the stress or strain components) can be requested as field output. Field output is composed of a cloud of data values (e.g., stress tensors at each integration point for all elements). Each data value has a location, type, and value. You use the regions defined in the model data, such as an element set, to access subsets of the field output data. :numref:`odb-field-nls` shows the field output data object model within an output database."
