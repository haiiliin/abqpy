Each node of the element is placed on a coordinate axis at a distance of :math:`1.0` from the origin that serves as the reference point for the infinite element. The acoustic material properties do not have physical significance; the values used are for convenience only. The loading consists of applying an in-phase pressure boundary condition to all the nodes. Under this loading and geometry, the model behaves as a spherical source (an acoustic monopole) radiating in the radial direction only. The acoustic pressure, :math:`p`, and the acoustic far-field pressure, :math:`p_{F A R}`, at a distance :math:`r` from the center of the sphere are"
