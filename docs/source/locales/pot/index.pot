msgid "`abqpy` is a Python package providing type hints for Python scripting of Abaqus, you can use it to write you Python script of Abaqus fluently, even without doing anything in Abaqus. It also provides some simple APIs to execute the Abaqus commands so that you can run your Python script to build the model, submit the job and extract the output data in just one Python script, even without opening the Abaqus/CAE."
