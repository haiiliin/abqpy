The following section is a basic tutorial for the experienced Abaqus user. It leads you through the Abaqus/CAE modeling process by visiting each of the modules and showing you the basic steps to create and analyze a simple model.\"). Additional examples are provided that read from an output database, display a contour plot, and print a contour plot from each step of the analysis. The final example illustrates how you can read from a model database created by Abaqus/CAE, parameterize the model, submit a set of analysis jobs, and generate results from the resulting output databases."

The functionality of the C++ API is identical to the Abaqus Scripting Interface API; however, the interactive nature of the Abaqus Scripting Interface and its integration with Abaqus/CAE makes it easier to use and program. The C++ interface is aimed at experienced C++ programmers who want to bypass the Abaqus Scripting Interface for performance considerations. The C++ API offers faster access to the output database, although this is a consideration only if you need to access large amounts of data."
