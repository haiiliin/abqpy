"The most convenient way to build an Abaqus model is to do it in Abaqus "
"CAE. When we use the Abaqus/CAE graphical user interface (GUI) to create "
"a model and to visualize the results, commands are issued internally by "
"Abaqus/CAE after every operation. These commands reflect the geometry you"
" created along with the options and settings you selected from each "
"dialog box."

#: ../../tutorials.rst:26

"Therefore, we can build our Abaqus model using Python script. We can "
"totally use the Python script to build our Abaqus model, although it is "
"not an efficient way. Usually, we do something in Abaqus/CAE, and check "
"the Python script in the reply file (`.rpy`). And then copy it to our "
"script file, this works, but not nicely."
