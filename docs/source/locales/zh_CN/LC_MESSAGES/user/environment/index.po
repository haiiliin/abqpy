"This section describes the **Abaqus Python development environment** "
"(PDE). The Abaqus PDE provides a simple interface that you can use to "
"develop—create, edit, test, and debug—Python scripts. The Abaqus PDE is "
"primarily intended for use with Abaqus/CAE user interface (GUI) and kernel"
" scripts, including plug-ins, but you can also use it to work on scripts "
"that function independently from Abaqus/CAE."
