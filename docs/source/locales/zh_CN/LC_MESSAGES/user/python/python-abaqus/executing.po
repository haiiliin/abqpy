msgid "You have seen how to execute Python statements from the stand-alone Python interpreter. If your script does not access the functionality of Abaqus/CAE, you can run the script by typing `abaqus python scriptname.py` at the system prompt. Abaqus will run the script through the Python interpreter and return you to the system prompt."

msgid "If your script accesses the functionality of any of the Abaqus/CAE modules, the statements must be interpreted by the Abaqus/CAE kernel; you cannot run the script from the Python interpreter invoked from the system prompt. You must execute the script in Abaqus/CAE by selecting **File -> Run Script** from the main menu bar and selecting the file to execute. In addition, the script must contain the following statements:"

msgid "When you run a script in Abaqus/CAE from the CLI, as part of a macro, or from the **File -> Run Script** menu option, Abaqus/CAE displays a stop button that you can use to stop a script that has been running for a predefined duration. If you want to display this button for scripts run using other methods, execute the `showStopButtonInGui` command from the `abaqus` module before you run the script. The command is not issued automatically when a script is run from the user interface; for example, as part of a plug-in."
