"You can use the Abaqus Scripting Interface to edit the abaqus_2021.gpr "

"preferences and GUI settings in the Abaqus/CAE user interface. To enable "
"editing of this file, you must import the caePrefsAccess module. This "
"section describes the structure of the abaqus_2021.gpr file and provides "
"an overview of customizing its settings; for more detailed information "
