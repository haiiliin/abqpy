msgid ""
"The command line interface is based on the "
"[`fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire)  package since version "
"`20**.5.0`, and it is not compatible with the command line interface of "
"previous versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:9
msgid ""
"The default execution procedure invoked by `abqpy` inside the Python "
"interpreter environment where it is installed is to run one of the two "
"following command lines:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:12
msgid "When the `abaqus` module is imported for the first time:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:18
msgid "When the `odbAccess` module is imported for the first time:"

#: ../../cli.md:24
msgid ""
"These commands lines are invoked when you run your script containing the "
"above statements in your installed Python interpreter, with a simple "
"command line launch:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:31
msgid ""
"However, there are other execution procedures that can be run with the "
"`abaqus` command and also another options that could be passed to these "
"commands. To supply that procedures and options, `abqpy` provides two "
"alternatives. One of them is a separate **command line interface** "
"(another alternative is to use an {doc}`System Environment Variable "
"<envvars>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:37
msgid ""
"Currently, `abqpy` command line interface provides several execution "
"modes: **Abaqus/CAE Execution** mode and **Abaqus Python Execution** mode,"
" and more:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:42
msgid ""
"where `COMMAND` is one of `abaqus`, `cae`, `python`, `run` or any other "
"Abaqus commands,  `SCRIPT` is the file name of your python script, `flags`"
" are the options that could be  passed to the command, and `ARGS` are the "
"extra arguments to be passed after the command  line options. For details,"
" see the [References](#references) section or run  `abqpy COMMAND --help` "
"for help."

"For the following commands, the boolean flags can be specified with the "
"following syntax (take `gui` as an example):"

"If you want to run you python script in Abaqus/CAE mode, you could run:"

"If you want to run your python script in Abaqus/CAE GUI or noGUI mode, "

"Some modern Python IDEs allow you to customize the default python launch "
"parameters that will be passed to the interpreter. This feature permits to"
" run `abqpy` command line interface as a module script and customize your "
"default abaqus execution procedure."

"Example: In [VS Code Python "
"Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-"
"python.python), you can specify the following setting:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:101
msgid ""
"That setting will make VS Code Python Extension run by default all python "
"script files in the integrated terminal with the following command line:"

#: ../../cli.md:108
msgid ""
"Which provides a way to change the default abaqus execution procedure to "
"GUI mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cli.md:111
msgid ""
"Noted that if a token other than another flag immediately follows a flag "
"that's supposed to be a boolean,  the flag will take on the value of the "
"token rather than the boolean value.  Thus `--gui=True` instead of `--gui`"
" is used here to prevent this problem."
