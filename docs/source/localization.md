# Documentation Localization

The documentation is localized using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/),
and translation files are placed in the [abqpy-locale](https://github.com/haiiliin/abqpy-locale) repository.
The translation takes place at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/abqpy-locale).
If you would like to help translate the documentation, please visit the
[Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/abqpy-locale) and sign up for an
account. Once you have an account, you can request to join the translation team.

To add a new language, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/haiiliin/abqpy/issues)
or open a pull request with the new language code added to the `docs/update-locale.sh` script.
