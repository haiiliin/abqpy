class Region:
    """The purpose of the Region object is to provide a link between an attribute and the
    geometric or discrete entities to which the attribute is applied. An attribute (Load,
    BC, IC, etc.) is applied to one or more Region objects; each Region object in turn is
    associated with a picked Set or Surface or with a named Set or Surface. The Region
    object provides a unified interface (or "fa√ßade") to data and functionality located at
    the Set or Surface.
    A script that applies an attribute to a picked Set or Surface requires the explicit
    creation of a Region object and will implicitly create a matching internal Set or
    Surface. Conversely, a script that applies an attribute to a named Set or Surface
    requires the explicit creation of that Set or Surface (see 39.4) and will implicitly
    create a region object.
    The reference between Region and Set/Surface is by name (user-provided or internal.) If
    the Set/Surface is suppressed, deleted, or renamed, the Region object will not be able
    to find the associated Set/Surface, and will communicate that to the attribute, but will
    not be affected otherwise. If a Set/Surface with the same name becomes available (only
    possible with user-provided names) the Region object will re-establish the connection.
    Another way of correcting this problem is to re-apply the attribute.
    Wherever a particular Load, BC, IC, etc. command accepts a named set or a named surface,
    that command will also accept a Region object. For example::

        myRegion = regionToolset.Region(edges=edges1)
        mdb.models['Model-1'].DisplacementBC(name='BC-1'
            createStepName='Initial', region=myRegion, u1=SET
            u2=SET)
        myRegion = regionToolset.Region(elements=e[1:100])
        p = mdb.models['mirror'].parts['COLLAR_MIRROR-1']
        p.SectionAssignment(region=myRegion, sectionName='Section-1')

    Abaqus does not provide a regions repository; as an alternative, you should assign a
    variable to a Region object and refer to the variable. The lifecycle of a Region object
    is similar to the lifecycle of a Leaf object used by display groups; as a result, you
    should use a Region object immediately after you create it. The contents of a Region
    object are not intended to survive regeneration. If you use an out-of-date Region
    object, the script is unlikely to function correctly.
    Querying an attribute's Region will return a Region tuple. The contents of the tuple are
    the set name followed by the owners of the set and three flags expressed as integers.
    The flags indicate the region space, the type of region and the whether the region is an
    internal set.
