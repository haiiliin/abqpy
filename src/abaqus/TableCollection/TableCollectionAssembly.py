        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            A String specifying the key of the repository.
        elset
            A Region object specifying the region containing the elements that will be activated
            during the analysis.
        deformation
            A Boolean value specifying whether the elements that have not yet been activated will
            follow the deformations of the active elements. Set **deformation** = ON when the
            deformation of the active elements is excessive. The default value is OFF.
        freeSurfaceType
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the exposed areas of the element facets that are active
            for convection or radiation boundary conditions to be applied. Possible values are NONE
            and FACET. If **freeSurfaceType** = FACET, user subroutine UEPACTIVATIONFACET will be called
            at the start of the increment for each element. If **freeSurfaceType** = NONE, all the
            exposed areas of the element facets are considered. The default value is NONE.

        Returns
        -------
        ElementProgressiveActivation
            An ElementProgressiveActivation object.

        Raises
        ------
        AbaqusException
            If the region does not contain only elements.
