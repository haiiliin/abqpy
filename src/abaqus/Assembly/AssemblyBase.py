        properties: dict
            A Dictionary object with the following items:
            **area**: None or a Float specifying the sum of the area of the specified faces. The area

            **volume**: None or a Float specifying the volume of the specified regions.
            **volumeCentroid**: None or a tuple of three Floats representing the coordinates of the
            volume centroid.
            **massFromMassPerUnitSurfaceArea**: None or a Float specifying the mass due to mass per
            unit surface area.
            **mass**: None or a Float specifying the mass of the specified regions. It is the total
            mass and includes mass from quantities such as mass per unit surface area.
            **centerOfMass**: None or a tuple of three Floats representing the coordinates of the
            center of mass.
            **momentOfInertia**: None or a tuple of six Floats representing the moments of inertia
            about the center of mass or about the point specified.
            **warnings**: A tuple of SymbolicConstants representing the problems encountered while
            computing the mass properties. Possible SymbolicConstants are:
            UNSUPPORTED_ENTITIES: Some unsupported entities exist in the specified regions. The mass
            properties are computed only for beams, trusses, shells, solids, point and
            non-structural mass elements, and rotary inertia elements. The mass properties are not
            computed for axisymmetric elements, springs, connectors, gaskets, or any other elements.
            MISSING_THICKNESS: For some regions, the section definitions are missing thickness
            values.
            ZERO_THICKNESS: For some regions, the section definitions have a zero thickness value.
            VARIABLE_THICKNESS: The nodal thickness or field thickness specified for some regions
            has been ignored.
            NON_APPLICABLE_THICKNESS: For some regions, the thickness value is not applicable to the
            corresponding sections specified on the regions.
            MISSING_DENSITY: For some regions, the section definitions are missing material density
            values.
            MISSING_MATERIAL_DEFINITION: For some regions, the material definition is missing.
            ZERO_DENSITY: For some regions, the section definitions have a zero material density
            value.
            UNSUPPORTED_DENSITY: For some regions, either a negative material density or a
            temperature dependent density has been specified, or the material value is missing for
            one or more plies in the composite section.
            SHELL_OFFSETS: For shells, this method does not account for any offsets specified.
            MISSING_SECTION_DEFINITION: For some regions, the section definition is missing.
            UNSUPPORTED_SECTION_DEFINITION: The section definition provided for some regions is not
            supported.
            REINFORCEMENTS: This method does not account for any reinforcements specified on the
            model.
            SMEARED_PROPERTIES: For regions with composite section assignments, the density is
            smeared across the thickness. The volume centroid and center of mass computations for a
            composite shell use a lumped mass approach where the volume and mass is assumed to be
            lumped in the plane of the shell. As a result of these approximations the volume
            centroid, center of mass and moments of inertia may be slightly inaccurate for regions
            with composite section assignments.
            UNSUPPORTED_NON_STRUCTURAL_MASS_ENTITIES: This method does not account for any
            non-structural mass on wires.
            INCORRECT_MOMENT_OF_INERTIA: For geometry regions with non-structural mass per volume,
            the non-structural mass is assumed to be a point mass at the centroid of the regions.
            Thus, the moments of inertia may be inaccurate as the distribution of the non-structural
            mass is not accounted for. Use the mesh for accurately computing the moments of inertia.
            MISSING_BEAM_ORIENTATIONS: For some regions with beam section assignments, the beam
            section orientations are missing.
            UNSUPPORTED_BEAM_PROFILES: This method supports the Box, Pipe, Circular, Rectangular,
            Hexagonal, Trapezoidal, I, L, T, Arbitrary, and Tapered beam profiles. Any other beam
            profile is not supported.
            TAPERED_BEAM_MI: Moment of inertia calculations for tapered beams are not accurate.
            SUBSTRUCTURE_INCORRECT_PROPERTIES: The user assigned density and thickness is not
            considered for substructures.
