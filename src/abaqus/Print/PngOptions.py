        Parameters
        ----------
        imageSize
            The SymbolicConstant SIZE_ON_SCREEN or a pair of Ints specifying the width and height of
            the image in pixels. Possible values are (**minWidth**, **minHeight**) ≤ **imageSize** ≤
            (**maxWidth** and **maxHeight**). The default value is SIZE_ON_SCREEN.

            of pixels that occupy 10 mm at the current screen resolution. The value is typically

        Raises
        ------
        RangeError: imageSize must be SIZE_ON_SCREEN or a sequence of 2 Ints in the range
        (minWidth, minHeight) <= (width, height) <= (maxWidth, maxHeight)
            If either the width or height arguments of **imageSize** are out of range (where
            **minWidth** and **minHeight** are the number of pixels corresponding to approximately 10 mm
            for a given display and **maxWidth** and **maxHeight** are the largest allowable number of
            pixels supported by the system graphics).
