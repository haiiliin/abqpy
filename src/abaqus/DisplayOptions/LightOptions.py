    """The LightOptions object stores settings that control how objects are lit when the
    **renderStyle** is set to SHADED. LightOptions objects are accessed in one of two ways:
    - The default light options. These settings are used as defaults when you start a
    session and by the Defaults button on the Light ConstrainedSketchOptions dialog box.
    - The light options associated with a particular viewport.
    The LightOptions object has no constructor; Abaqus creates the **defaultLightOptions**
    member when a session is started. When a new viewport is created, the **lightOptions**
    member is copied from the current viewport.
