        Parameters
        ----------
        enabled
            A Boolean specifying whether the light is on or off. The default value is OFF.
        type
            A SymbolicConstant specifying how the effect of the light should be calculated. Possible
            values are:DIRECTIONAL, specifying a constant vector should be used for the direction
            from the light to a vertex.POINT, specifying the vector from the light to each vertex
            should be calculated.The default value is DIRECTIONAL.When set to **type** =DIRECTIONAL, a
            constant vector is used for the direction from the light to a vertex. When **type**
            =POINT, the result is more realistic because the actual vector from the light to each
            vertex is calculated. However, overall performance is decreased.
        latitude
            A Float specifying the altitude of the light above or below the camera. Possible values
            are -90.0 ≤ **latitude** ≤ 90.0. The default value is 0.0.
        longitude
            A Float specifying the east/west position of the light to the left or right of the
            camera. Possible values are -90.0 ≤ **longitude** ≤ 90.0. The default value is 0.0.
        diffuseColor
            A String specifying the color of the light added to the scene by this light source. The
            initial value is 70% gray. A list of valid color strings is in the **colors** map in the
            **session** object.
        specularColor
            A String specifying the color of the specular highlights created by this light source.
            The initial value is 36% gray. A list of valid color strings is in the **colors** map in
            the **session** object.

        Raises
        ------
        RangeError
