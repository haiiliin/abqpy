class GraphicsOptions:
    """The GraphicsOptions object stores settings that control how objects are rendered in all
    viewports. GraphicsOptions objects are accessed in one of two ways:
    - The default graphics options. These settings are used as defaults when you start a
    session and by the Defaults button on the Graphics ConstrainedSketchOptions dialog box.
    - The current graphics options.
    The GraphicsOptions object has no constructor; Abaqus creates both the
    **defaultGraphicsOptions** and the **graphicsOptions** members when a session is started.
    When you start a session, Abaqus detects the graphics hardware installed on your system
    and uses the setValues method in the environment file (abaqus_v6.env ) to modify the
    members of the GraphicsOptions object. If your graphics hardware is not supported by
    Abaqus/CAE, or if you wish to override the default graphics options, you can modify
    settings in the environment file. For more information, see Tuning graphics cards.

    .. note::
        This object can be accessed by::

    #: (slower) technique will be used to create off-screen images. Off-screen rendering is
    #: used for Printing, Probe, and backing store (viewport refresh). Setting this value to

            incompatible with Abaqus/CAE. **hardwareAcceleration** is used only when you first start
            Abaqus/CAE on a Windows platform; you cannot configure **hardwareAcceleration** during a
            session. **hardwareAcceleration** is not used when you start Abaqus/CAE on an X-Windows
            platform and display to a Windows platform running Exceed or any other X-Windows server.
        hardwareOverlay
            A Boolean specifying whether hardware overlay planes will be used if available. The
            default value is the same value as the **hardwareOverlayAvailable** member.When
            **hardwareOverlayAvailable** = OFF, it will not be possible to set **hardwareOverlay** to ON
            and the HARDWARE_OVERLAY highlight method will not be available. If viewports display a
            solid color and will not display the model, it will be necessary to inhibit hardware
            overlay completely by setting the ABAQUS_EMULATE_OVERLAYS environment variable (to any
            value) before starting Abaqus/CAE. **hardwareOverlay** is used only when you first start
            Abaqus/CAE; you cannot configure **hardwareOverlay** during a session.
        textureMapping
            A Boolean specifying whether textures will be used to display contour plots. The default
            value is ON.Turning off texture mapping is necessary only if viewports will not
            correctly display a contour plot of your model.
        printTextureMapping
            A Boolean specifying whether textures will be used to display contour plots. The default
            value is ON.Turning off texture mapping for printing is necessary only if printed output
            does not correctly display a contour plot of your model. **printTextureMapping** is
            similar to **textureMapping**; however, **printTextureMapping** is used when printing and
            **textureMapping** is used for display. Some systems, especially Windows, use different
            OpenGL drivers for printing and display, and you may have to use different settings for
            each driver.
        backgroundStyle
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the background style to be used for all viewport windows.
            Possible values are SOLID and GRADIENT. The default value is SOLID.If
            **backgroundStyle** = SOLID, the viewport background will appear as a solid color as
            specified by **backgroundColor**. If **backgroundStyle** = GRADIENT, the viewport background
            will be drawn as a gradient beginning with the **backgroundColor** at the top of the
            viewport and gradually blending to the **backgroundBottomColor** at the bottom of the
            viewport.
        backgroundColor
            A String specifying one of the two background colors for all viewport windows. The
            initial color is black. A list of valid color strings is in the **colors** map in the
            Session object.
        backgroundBottomColor
            A String specifying one of the two background colors for all viewport windows. This
            color is used only if **backgroundStyle** =GRADIENT. The initial color is black. A list of
            valid color strings is in the **colors** map in the Session object.
        backgroundOverride
            A Boolean specifying whether a viewport background style of GRADIENT can be overridden
            when displaying certain objects, such as sketches or XY plots. When overridden, the
            background will be the top color of the gradient background.
        backfaceCulling
            A Boolean specifying whether facets that are determined to be facing away from the
            viewer will be drawn. The default value is ON. backfaceCulling provides a performance
            enhancement when displaying solid elements where the front side of the element occludes
            the back side of the element. Set **backfaceCulling** = OFF if it appears that you are
            seeing the back side of an element and the front side is missing. You should also set
            **backfaceCulling** = OFF if you believe the display is not complete.
        accelerateOffScreen
            A Boolean specifying whether the hardware accelerated graphics driver will be used for
            off-screen rendering. The default value is ON if graphics hardware acceleration is
            available and has not been disabled via the hardwareAcceleration option, and the
            graphics driver supports the underlying technology. When set to OFF, an alternate
            (slower) technique will be used to create off-screen images. Off-screen rendering is
            used for Printing, Probe, and backing store (viewport refresh). Setting this value to
            OFF will force printed images to be rendered without hardware acceleration. This is
            useful when writing automated tests to produce raster images that you will want to
            compare across multiple machines that may have different graphics environments.
        backingStore
            A Boolean specifying whether a backing store will be used to refresh a viewport after a
            window occluding the viewport is moved or dismissed. The default value is ON.
        shadersAvailable
            A Boolean specifying if the graphics hardware supports the OpenGL Shading Language
            (GLSL).
        translucencyMode
            An Int specifying whether speed or accuracy is more important when drawing translucent
            objects. Lower values optimize for speed while higher values optimize for accuracy. The
            actual meaning of each setting will depend on the setting of **shadersAvailable** and the
            capabilities of the graphics hardware and driver. Possible values are 1 ≤
            **translucencyMode** ≤ 6. The default value is 4.
        options
            None or a GraphicsOptions object specifying the object from which values are to be
            copied. If other arguments are also supplied to setValues, they will override the values
            in the **options** member. The default value is None.
        contourRangeTexturePrecision
            A Float specifying a tolerance used when computing the appropriate scale for
            transforming result (contour) values to texture values. When set too low the 'out of
            range' colors may be incorrectly shown for values near the range limits. The default
            value is 0.5×10-5.

        Raises

        RangeError
