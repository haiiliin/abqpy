The markdown files for classes are arranged with the following rules:

- The file name is the class name;
- The class inheritance is shown in the figure at the start of the file;
- The class docstring is placed before the constructor at the begin of the file;
- Methods must contain "()", there might be overload methods, for overload methods, please use @overload from typing module;

Following these rules when generating:
- Follow the general style in sample.py;
- Ignore redundant texts;
- Use Numpy style for docstring.
- Use relative imports for importing parent classes;
