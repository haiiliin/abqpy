    """This function can be used to upgrade a directory, a file, or a list of both directories and files. You
    can preview the changes before you choose to upgrade the file. A user interface to this function is
    available via the Plug-ins menu. For more information, see Upgrading a script. You can also use a simpler
    interface from the command line to upgrade scripts. For more information, see the summary of changed
    commands at the end of this guide.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fileNames
        A String or sequence of Strings specifying the files or directories to upgrade. If a
        directory path is found, it will be searched for files with the suffix .py or .guiLog.
        If **searchSubdirectories** is True, any directories found within a directory will also be
        searched.
    searchSubdirectories
        A Boolean specifying whether to search any subdirectories (if the file name is a
        directory). If **searchSubdirectories** is True, the command will search the
        subdirectories of any directory in **fileNames**. If **searchSubdirectories** is False, the
        command will search the directory but not the subdirectories. The default value is True.
    backup
        A Boolean specifying whether to make backups of the files. The default value is True.
        This argument is ignored if **preview** is set.
    preview
        A Boolean specifying whether to preview the changes to the file instead of changing the
        file. If **preview** is True, display a preview of the file changes. The default value is
        True.By default, the preview is displayed in a web browser. The **diffExecutable**
        argument allows you to specify a different application in which to preview the changes.
    diffExecutable
        A String specifying the application used to display the differences between the script
        and the upgraded script. The default value is an empty string, and the differences are
        displayed by a web browser. Examples of values for **diffExecutable** are winmerge and
        diff. This argument is ignored if **preview** is False.
    logFileName
        A String specifying the name of the log file where any warnings and changes found during
        the upgrade are written. The default value is asiUpgrade.log.
    fromVersion
        A String specifying the Abaqus release from which to upgrade. The default value is
        EARLIEST.
    toVersion
        A String specifying the Abaqus release to which to upgrade. The default value is LATEST.
    scriptType
        A SymbolicConstant specifying the type of scripting commands to be upgraded. Possible
        values are KERNEL, GUI, or BOTH. If **scriptType** is KERNEL only Abaqus Scripting
        Interface commands will be upgraded; if **scriptType** is GUI only Abaqus GUI Toolkit
        commands will be upgraded. The default value is BOTH.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The number of changes made or, if **preview** was used, the number of changes that would
        have been made.
