        Parameters
        ----------
        imageName
            A String specifying the name of the image. A list of valid image names is in the
            **images** repository in the **session** object.
        showImage
            A Boolean specifying whether an image should be displayed in the sketcher background.
            The default value is OFF.
        origin
            A pair of Floats specifying the **X**  and **Y** offsets in millimeters from the lower-left
            corner of the viewport. The default value is (0, 0).
        xScale
            A Float specifying the scale applied to the image width. The default value is 1.0.When
            **xScale** is negative, the image is mirrored about its y-axis but its position is not
            affected.
        yScale
            A Float specifying the scale applied to the image height. The default value is 1.0.When
            **yScale** is negative, the image is mirrored about its x-axis but its position is not
            affected.
        translucency
            A Float specifying the translucency factor to use when displaying the image. Possible
            values are 0.0 ≤ **translucency** ≤ 1.0 with 0.0 being invisible and 1.0 being opaque.
            The default value is 1.0.
