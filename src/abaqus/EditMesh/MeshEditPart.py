            A Float specifying the edge length tolerance. During the operation, edges shorter than

        growEdges
            A Boolean specifying whether short element edges will be grown to the specified
            tolerance. Default is False, meaning short edges will be collapsed.
        elements
            The elements to consider as the domain for the operation. By default all elements on the
            part are considered. The elements may be given as a MeshElementArray, a list of
            MeshElement objects, a Set, or a list of Set objects.
        refEdge
            A MeshEdge specifying a reference edge to indicate a topological direction in a
            structured mesh that will limit which edges within the element domain are considered.
            That is, only edges that are found to be topologically parallel to the given reference
            edge will be considered by the operation. By default all edges of the element domain are
            considered, unless **thicknessDir** is specified, in which case the operation will attempt

            **growEdges** is True and **thicknessDir** is provided. When this argument is True the

        elements
            A MeshElementArray, a list of MeshElement objects, a Set, or a list of Set objects
            containing the elements to be subdivided. By default all the elements of the part are
            subdivided.
        divisionNumber
            An Int specifying the number of resulting elements for each input element in each
            direction of the subdivision. If **face** or **edge** are not specified, elements will be
            subdivided according to this number in all possible directions. Must be greater than
            one. Default is 2.
        face
            A MeshFace object that serves as a reference for indicating two topological directions
            for the subdivision operation. Must be a face of one of the specified elements, and all
            specified elements must be reachable by topological navigation from this element face.
            May not be combined with **edge**.
        edge
            A MeshEdge object that serves as a reference for indicating a single topological
            direction for the subdivision operation. Must be an edge of one of the specified
            elements, and all specified elements must be reachable by topological navigation from
            this element edge. May not be combined with **face**.
