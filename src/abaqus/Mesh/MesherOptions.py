        Parameters
        ----------
        elemShape2D
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the default element shape for meshing two-dimensional
            objects. Possible values are QUAD, QUAD_DOMINATED, and TRI. The default value is
            QUAD_DOMINATED.
        elemShape3D
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the default element shape for meshing three-dimensional
            objects. Possible values are HEX, HEX_DOMINATED, WEDGE, and TET. The default value is
            HEX.
        quadAlgorithm
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the default algorithm for meshing an object with quad- or
            quad-dominated elements. Possible values are ADVANCING_FRONT and MEDIAL_AXIS. The
            default value is ADVANCING_FRONT.
        allowMapped
            A Boolean specifying whether Abaqus/CAE should allow mapped meshing, where appropriate.
            The default value is OFF.
        minTransition
            A Boolean specifying whether Abaqus/CAE should attempt to minimize the mesh transition
            when it moves from a coarse mesh to a fine mesh. The default value is ON.
