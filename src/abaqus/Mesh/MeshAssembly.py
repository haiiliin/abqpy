        """This method assigns element types to the specified regions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        regions
            A sequence of ConstrainedSketchGeometry regions or MeshElement objects, or a Set object containing either
            geometry regions or elements, specifying the regions to which element types are to be
            assigned.
        elemTypes
            A sequence of ElemType objects, one for each element shape applicable to the
            regions. Note: If an ElemType object has an UNKNOWN_*xxx* value for **elemCode**, its order
            will be deduced from the order of other valid ElemType objects within the same
            setElementType command. If no valid ElemType objects can be found, the order will remain
            unchanged.

        Raises
        ------
        Exception
            As a result of the element assignment, a region must have the same library, family, and
            order for all its assigned element types. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.
            For example, suppose the Hex, Wedge, and Tet elements previously assigned to a cell are
            all linear. The user now constructs an ElemType object with a quadratic Hex element and
            includes only this object in the setElementType command. An exception will be thrown
            because the Wedge and Tet elements will remain linear (i.e., As Is) and become
            incompatible with the newly assigned quadratic Hex element.

        ----------
        regions
            A sequence of Face or Cell regions specifying the regions for which to set the mesh
            control parameters.
        elemShape
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the element shape to be used for meshing. The default
            value is QUAD for Face regions and HEX for Cell regions. If unspecified, the existing
            element shape will remain unchanged. Possible values are:

            - QUAD: Quadrilateral mesh.
            - QUAD_DOMINATED: Quadrilateral-dominated mesh.
            - TRI: Triangular mesh.
            - HEX: Hexahedral mesh.
            - HEX_DOMINATED: Hex-dominated mesh.
            - TET: Tetrahedral mesh.
            - WEDGE: Wedge mesh.
        technique
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the mesh technique to be used. The default value is FREE
            for Face regions. For Cell regions the initial value depends on the geometry of the
            regions and can be STRUCTURED, SWEEP, or unmeshable. If unspecified, the existing mesh
            technique(s) will remain unchanged. Possible values are:

            - FREE: Free mesh technique.
            - STRUCTURED: Structured mesh technique.
            - SWEEP: Sweep mesh technique.
            - BOTTOM_UP: Bottom-up mesh technique. Only applicable for cell regions.
            - SYSTEM_ASSIGN: Allow the system to assign a suitable technique. The actual technique
              assigned can be STRUCTURED, SWEEP, or “unmeshable”.
        algorithm
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the algorithm used to generate the mesh for the specified
            regions. Possible values are MEDIAL_AXIS, ADVANCING_FRONT, and NON_DEFAULT. If
            unspecified, the existing value will remain unchanged. This option is applicable only to
            the following:

            - Free quadrilateral or quadrilateral-dominated meshing. In this case the possible
              values are MEDIAL_AXIS and ADVANCING_FRONT.
            - Sweep hexahedral or hexahedral-dominated meshing. In this case the possible values are
              MEDIAL_AXIS and ADVANCING_FRONT.
            - Free tetrahedral meshing. In this case the only possible value is NON_DEFAULT, and it
              indicates that the free tetrahedral-meshing technique available in Abaqus 6.4 or earlier
              will be used. If algorithm is not specified, the default tetrahedral-meshing technique
              will be used.
        minTransition
            A Boolean specifying whether minimum transition is to be applied. The default value is
            ON. If unspecified, the existing value will remain unchanged. This option is applicable
            only in the following cases:

            - Free quadrilateral meshing or hexahedral sweep meshing with **algorithm** = MEDIAL_AXIS.
            - Structured quadrilateral meshing.
        sizeGrowth
            A SymbolicConstant specifying element size growth to be applied when generating the
            interior of a tetrahedral mesh. Possible values are MODERATE and MAXIMUM. If
            unspecified, the existing value will remain unchanged. This option only applies to the
            default tetrahedral mesher.
        allowMapped
            A Boolean specifying whether mapped meshing can be used to replace the selected mesh
            technique. The **allowMapped** argument is applicable only in the following cases:

            - Free triangular meshing.
            - Free quadrilateral or quadrilateral-dominated meshing with
              **algorithm** = ADVANCING_FRONT.
            - Hexahedral or hexahedral-dominated sweep meshing with **algorithm** = ADVANCING_FRONT.
            - Free tetrahedral meshing. **allowMapped** = True implies that mapped triangular meshing
              can be used on faces that bound three-dimensional **regions**.

        """This method tests the quality of part instance meshes and returns poor-quality elements.

        Parameters
        ----------
        criterion
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the criterion used for the quality check. Possible values
            are:

            - ANALYSIS_CHECKS
              When this criterion is specified Abaqus/CAE will invoke the element quality checks
              included with the input file processor for Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit.
            - ANGULAR_DEVIATION
              The maximum amount (in degrees) that an element's face corner angles deviate from the
              ideal angle. The ideal angle is 90° for quadrilateral element faces and 60° for
              triangular element faces. Elements with an angular deviation larger than the specified
              threshold will fail this test.
            - ASPECT_RATIO
              The ratio between the lengths of the longest and shortest edges of an element. Elements
              with an aspect ratio larger than the specified threshold will fail this test.
            - GEOM_DEVIATION_FACTOR
              The largest geometric deviation factor evaluated along any of the element edges
              associated with geometric edges or faces. The geometric deviation factor along an
              element edge is calculated by dividing the maximum gap between the element edge and its
              associated geometry by the length of the element edge. Elements with a geometric
              deviation factor larger than the specified threshold will fail this test.
            - LARGE_ANGLE
              The largest corner angle on any of an element's faces. Elements with face angles larger
              than the specified threshold (in degrees) will fail this test.
            - LONGEST_EDGE
              The length of an element's longest edge. Elements with an edge longer than the specified
              threshold will fail this test.
            - MAX_FREQUENCY
              An estimate of an element's contribution to the initial maximum allowable frequency for
              Abaqus/Standard analyses. This calculation requires appropriate section assignments and
              material definitions. Elements whose maximum allowable frequency is smaller than the
              given value will fail this test.
            - SHAPE_FACTOR
              The shape factor for triangular and tetrahedral elements. This is the ratio between the
              element area or volume and the optimal element area or volume. Elements with a shape
              factor smaller than the specified threshold will fail this test.
            - SHORTEST_EDGE
              The length of an element's shortest edge. Elements with an edge shorter than the
              specified threshold will fail this test.
            - SMALL_ANGLE
              The smallest corner angle on any of an element's faces. Elements with face angles
              smaller than the given value (in degrees) will fail this test.
            - STABLE_TIME_INCREMENT
              An estimate of an element's contribution to the initial maximum stable time increment
              for Abaqus/Explicit analyses. This calculation requires appropriate section assignments
              and material definitions. Elements that require a time increment smaller than the given
              value will fail this test.
        threshold
            A Float value used to determine low quality elements according to the specified
            criterion. This argument is ignored when the ANALYSIS_CHECKS criterion is used. For
            other criterion, if this argument is unspecified then no list of failed elements will be
            returned.
        elemShape
            A SymbolicConstant specifying an element shape for limiting the query. Possible values
            are LINE, QUAD, TRI, HEX, WEDGE, and TET.
        regions
            A sequence of Region or MeshElement objects. If you do not specify the **regions**
            argument, all meshes in the assembly are considered.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, int | float | MeshElement]
