    """The AbaqusNDarray object is a sequence object derived from numpy.ndarray and is used to
    store numeric keyword data from an Abaqus input file. This object is similar to the
    numpy.ndarray object, but the numeric elements are returned as standard Python objects,
    not numpy numeric types.
    The numeric elements can be:
    
    - All ints.
    - All floats.
    - First column int, all other columns floats.
    
    In the last of these cases, the member **colZeroIsInt** will be True; in the other two
    cases, it will be False.
