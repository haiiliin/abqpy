        penetrationPressure
            A tuple of Floats specifying the fluid pressure magnitude. For steady state dynamic
            analyses, a tuple of Complexes specifying the fluid pressure magnitude.
        criticalPressure
            A tuple of Floats specifying the critical contact pressure below which fluid penetration
            starts to occur.
        amplitude
            A String or the SymbolicConstant UNSET specifying the name of the amplitude reference.
            UNSET should be used if the load has no amplitude reference. The default value is UNSET.
