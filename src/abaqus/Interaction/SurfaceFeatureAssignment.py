        stepName
            A String specifying the name of the step in which the surface feature assignments are to
            be modified.
        index
            An Int specifying the position of the surface feature angle assignment whose value is to
            be modified.
        value
            A tuple specifying the value of the surface feature assignments for the surface whose
            index is referenced. Each tuple contains two entries for Abaqus/Standard and three
            entries for Abaqus/Explicit:

            - A Float or a SymbolicConstant specifying the overriding surface primary feature angle
              value to be used for the surface. Possible values of the SymbolicConstant are PERIMETER,
              ALL, PICKED, or NONE. The ALL and PICKED values cannot be specified with the GLOBAL
              region constant and can be used only in the Abaqus/Explicit version of general contact.
            - A Float or a SymbolicConstant specifying the overriding surface secondary feature
              angle value to be used for the surface. Possible values of the SymbolicConstant are
              PERIMETER, ALL, PICKED, or NONE. The ALL and PICKED values cannot be specified with the
              GLOBAL region constant and can be used only in the Abaqus/Explicit version of general

            - A SymbolicConstant ORIGINAL or CURRENT specifying the configuration.
        useDynFeatEdge
            A Boolean specifying whether the dynamic feature edge criterion should be activated for the contact surface
            in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis. This argument can be set to ON (default) or OFF.
