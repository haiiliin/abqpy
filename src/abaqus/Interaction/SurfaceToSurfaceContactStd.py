        datumAxis
            A DatumAxis object specifying the orientation of the bolt hole when specifying bolt
            clearance.
        useReverseDatumAxis
            A Boolean specifying whether to reverse the bolt clearance direction given by the datum
            axis. The default value is OFF.
        clearanceRegion
            A Region object specifying the contact region for which clearance is specified.
        surfaceSmoothing
            A SymbolicConstant specifying whether to use surface smoothing for geometric surfaces in
            SurfaceToSurfaceContactStd interactions. Possible values are AUTOMATIC and NONE. The
            default value is NONE.
        bondingSet
            A Region object specifying the secondary node sub-set for bonding, used only when the
            contact property CohesiveBehavior option specifies use.
        handedness
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the bolt handedness formulation. Possible values are RIGHT
            and LEFT. The default value is RIGHT.

                The `normalAdjustment` argument was added.
        normalAdjustment
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the bolt normal adjustment formulation for all secondary
            nodes. Possible values are UNIFORM AXIAL COMPONENT and LOCATION DEPENDENT. The default
            value is UNIFORM AXIAL COMPONENT.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stepName
            A String specifying the name of the step in which the interaction is modified.
        interactionProperty
            A String specifying the name of the ContactProperty object associated with this
            interaction.
        interferenceType
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the type of time-dependent allowable interference for
            contact pairs and contact elements. Possible values are:

            - NONE, specifying no allowable contact interference.
            - SHRINK_FIT.
            - UNIFORM.

            The default value is NONE.
        overclosure
            A Float specifying the maximum overclosure distance allowed. This argument applies only
            when **interferenceType** = UNIFORM. The default value is 0.0.
        interferenceDirectionType
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the method used to determine the interference direction.
            Possible values are COMPUTED and DIRECTION_COSINE. The default value is COMPUTED.
        direction
            A sequence of three Floats specifying the following:

            - XX-direction cosine of the interference direction vector.
            - YY-direction cosine of the interference direction vector.
            - ZZ-direction cosine of the interference direction vector.

            This argument is required only when **interferenceDirectionType** = DIRECTION_COSINE.
        amplitude
            A String specifying the name of the amplitude curve that defines the magnitude of the
            prescribed interference during the step. Use None to specify that the prescribed
            interference is applied immediately at the beginning of the step and ramped down to zero
            linearly over the step.
        contactControls
            A String specifying the name of the ContactControl object associated with this
            interaction. The empty string indicates that the default contact controls will be used.
            The default value is an empty string.
