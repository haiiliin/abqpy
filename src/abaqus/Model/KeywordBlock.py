        Parameters
        ----------
        storeNodesAndElements
            A Boolean specifying whether the nodal coordinates and element connectivities (i.e. the
            data lines for the *NODE and *ELEMENT keyword blocks) are to be stored in the
            **sieBlocks** member. All other keywords and their data lines are always stored. The
            default value is True. If **storeNodesAndElements** is True, the size of the keywordBlock
            data will be similar to that of the input file. Since the KeywordBlock is stored in the
            Abaqus/CAE database, this will result in a larger database. It will also result in a
            slower execution of the synchVersions command. If **storeNodesAndElements** is False, the
            data lines are not stored in **sieBlocks**. Consequently, only set
            **storeNodesAndElements** = True if you wish to make changes to the **NODE** or **ELEMENT** data
            lines themselves. If your task is limited to reading nodal coordinates and element
            connectivities (i.e. not editing this information) then it is generally better to access
            this information from other parts of the Mdb.
