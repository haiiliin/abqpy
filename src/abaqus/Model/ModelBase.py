        sectionConsolidation
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the method used to create shell section. Possible values
            are PRESERVE_SECTION, GROUP_BY_MATERIAL, and NONE. If PRESERVE_SECTION is used, an
            Abaqus section is created corresponding to each shell property ID. If GROUP_BY_MATERIAL
            is used, a single Abaqus section is created for all homogeneous elements referencing the
            same material. In both cases, material orientations and offsets are created using
            discrete fields. If NONE is used, a separate shell section is created for each
            combination of orientation, material offset, and/or thickness. The default is
            PRESERVE_SECTION.
        preIntegratedShell

            a multiplier for all density, mass, and rotary inertia values created in the Abaqus
            input file. The default value is ON.
        loadCases
            A Boolean specifying whether each SUBCASE for linear static analyses is translated to a
            LOAD CASE option, and all such LOAD CASE options are grouped in a single STEP option.
            The default value is ON.
        coupleBeamOffsets
            A Boolean specifying whether to translate the beam element connectivity to newly created
            nodes at the offset location and rigidly coupling the new and original nodes. If not,
            beam element offsets are translated to the CENTROID and SHEAR CENTER options, which are
            suboptions of the BEAM GENERAL SECTION option. The default value is ON. When the beam
            element references a PBARL or PBEAML property or if the beam offset has a significant
            component in the direction of the beam axis, the setting for this argument is always ON.
        cbar
            A String specifying the 2-node beam that is created from CBAR and CBEAM elements.
            Possible values are B31 and B33. The default is B31.
        cquad4

            values are S4 and S4R. The default is S4. If a reduced-integration element is chosen,
            the enhanced hourglass formulation is applied automatically.

            values are C3D8I, C3D8 and C3D8R. The default is C3D8I. If a reduced-integration element
            is chosen, the enhanced hourglass formulation is applied automatically.
        ctetra
            A String specifying the 10-node tetrahedron that is created from CTETRA elements.
            Possible values are C3D10 and C3D10M. The default is C3D10.
        keepTranslatedFiles
            A Boolean specifying whether to keep the generated Abaqus input file after the model is
            created from the Nastran input file. The default value is ON.
