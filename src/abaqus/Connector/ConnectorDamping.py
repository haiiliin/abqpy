class ConnectorDamping(ConnectorBehaviorOption):
    """The ConnectorDamping object defines damping behavior for one or more components of a
    connector's relative motion.
    The ConnectorDamping object is derived from the ConnectorBehaviorOption object.

    .. note::
        This object can be accessed by::

            import section
            mdb.models[name].sections[name].behaviorOptions[i]
            import odbSection
            session.odbs[name].sections[name].behaviorOptions[i]

        The table data for this object are:

        - If **behavior** = LINEAR and **coupling** = UNCOUPLED, then each sequence of the table data specifies the following:

            - Damping coefficient (force or moment per relative velocity).
            - Frequency (cycles/time), if the data depend on frequency.
            - Temperature, if the data depend on temperature.
            - Value of the first field variable, if the data depend on field variables.
            - Value of the second field variable.
            - Etc.
        - If **behavior** = NONLINEAR and **coupling** = UNCOUPLED, then each sequence of the table data specifies the following:

            - Force or moment.
            - Relative displacement or rotation.
            - Temperature, if the data depend on temperature.
            - Value of the first field variable, if the data depend on field variables.
            - Value of the second field variable.
            - Etc.
        - If **behavior** = LINEAR and **coupling** = COUPLED, the table data specify the symmetric portion
            of the damping matrix for the specified components followed by any temperature data and then
            any field data. For example, if components 2, 3, and 5 are specified, the table portion of the command is as follows: table=( (C22C22, C23C23, C25C25, C33C33, C35C35, C55C55,), )
            The following items should then be specified as comma-separated data:

            - Temperature, if the data depend on temperature.
            - Value of the first field variable, if the data depend on field variables.
            - Value of the second field variable.
            - Etc.
        - If **behavior** = NONLINEAR and **coupling** = COUPLED_POSITION or COUPLED_MOTION, each sequence
            of the table data specifies the following:

            - Force or moment for the directions in the **components** list.
            - Relative velocity for the directions in the **components** list.
            - Relative position or angle for the first **independentComponents** direction if
                **coupling** = COUPLED_POSITION.
            - Relative displacement or rotation for the first **independentComponents** direction if
                **coupling** = COUPLED_MOTION.
            - Relative position or angle for the second **independentComponents** direction if
                **coupling** = COUPLED_POSITION.
            - Relative displacement or rotation for the second **independentComponents** direction if
                **coupling** = COUPLED_MOTION.
            - Etc. up to the Nth **independentComponents** direction.
            - Temperature, if the data depend on temperature.
            - Value of the first field variable, if the data depend on field variables.
            - Value of the second field variable.
            - Etc.
