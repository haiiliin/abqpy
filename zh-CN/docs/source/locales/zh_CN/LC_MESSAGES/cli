msgid "However, there are other execution procedures that can be run with the `abaqus` command and also another options that could be passed to these commands. To supply that procedures and options, `abqpy` provides two alternatives. One of them is a separate **command line interface** (another alternative is to use an {doc}`System Environment Variable <envvars>`)."

#: ../../cli.md:42
msgid "where `COMMAND` is one of `abaqus`, `cae`, `python`, `run` or any other Abaqus commands,  `SCRIPT` is the file name of your python script, `flags` are the options that could be  passed to the command, and `ARGS` are the extra arguments to be passed after the command  line options. For details, see the [References](#references) section or run  `abqpy COMMAND --help` for help."

msgid "Noted that if a token other than another flag immediately follows a flag that's supposed to be a boolean,  the flag will take on the value of the token rather than the boolean value.  Thus `--gui=True` instead of `--gui` is used here to prevent this problem."
